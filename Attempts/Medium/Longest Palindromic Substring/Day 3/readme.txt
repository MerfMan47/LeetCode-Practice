Getting back into it after a bit of a break. I've decided to
organize my code better by making heavier use of functions.
So far I'm liking it alot better this way. I made good
progress on this problem, all that's left is to replace the
empty array entires with the character that my code is using
as the start and end points of the palindrome.
