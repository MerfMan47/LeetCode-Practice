I'm finally starting to get back into LeetCode. Trying to learn
about hashmaps and the like. Turns out I was using quasi hashmaps
in the form of sets. The real thing have very similar logic but
it much more flexable and efficient. I also used a for-of loop
for the first time. I'm not sure if that came with ES6 of if it
was here the whole time and I never knew. Anyways it's a nice bit
of syntax to make standard for loops that use index based 
algorithms a bit more readable, always nice.

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
